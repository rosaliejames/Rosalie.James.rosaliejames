1. What does the git init command do? - creates or reinitializes a repository for a given existing directory of files 
2. What does git add do? How is it different from git commit? - git add stages your files aka adds your modified files to the queue of files to be committed, but you need to execute git commit in order to commit those changes (aka store those changes) in the local repository
3. What is the difference between staged and committed (or versioned) files? - staged files (git add) are in the queue to be committed to the local repository but have not yet been saved there; committed files have 
4. What's the shortcut for adding all files and commiting them? - $git commit -a
5. How do you unstage a staged file? How do you go back to an old version of a committed file? - $git rm removes an unstaged file, to go back to an old version of a committed file you find the commit you want by looking at git log (can look at them by $git diff <commit hash> <file name>) and then doing $ git checkout <commit hash> <filename>   
6.Why are commit messages very important? commit messages are so important because they make it easier to find older versions of your file you might want to go back to
7. How do I revert to a previous commit (i.e. go back to an earlier "draft")? checkout <commit hash> <filename>
8. How do you exit out of vi? (Also called vim.) :wq 

E2: GitHub Research
1. What's the difference between GitHub and git? Could git exist without GitHub? Could GitHub exist without git? - git is a revision control system, meaning it manages the history of your code. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. Git could exist without GitHub because GitHub is not the only hosting service, but GitHub could not exist without Git
2. Why is GitHub a cool company? - “GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features” -wikipedia
3. What does git push do? - git push moves files from your local repository (done with add and commit) to a remote repository such as github where it is stored “in the cloud”
4. What does git pull do? How is it different from/same as git fetch and git merge?-  git pull automatically does both git fetch and git merge - it gets the version stored and merges it with the version on your working directory
