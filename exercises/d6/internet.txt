E4: What is the Internet?
1. URL is called (this is a domain) 
2. client request is made to the server 
3. directed to an IP address (location of computer in the farm that is processing your request)
4. server response returns content of the web page 


1. What is a request? - asking for something (client - your computer - asks for information (an HTML page or the like) from a server when you call a url
2. What is making the request? - client (your computer by entering a URL)
3. Where does the request go (like physically, on Earth, as well as conceptually, on the internet)? What's its "address"? - the request goes to a server which is typically a computer in a computer farm whose physical location/address is represented by an IP 
4. What happens to the request when it gets "there"? - when the request gets “there”, it is sent to a particular computer which is assigned via IP address and then it requests web page data which is returned via a server response 
5. What comes back? What is it? What data does it contain?
What happens when it comes back? - what comes back is a server response aka the data in html/whatever form of the webpage you wanted to access so now you see the page 

E5: Ruby Rocks 
1. What shows up on the screen? - Error 404
2. What does it mean? - client is not authenticated (private repository —> cannot access)
3. Why is the error it displays that particular number? - because each number means something and in this case the client request is not authenticated to access the repository
4. Does this in fact mean that Ruby does not rock? - nope just that I cannot see that Ruby does not rock
