## Code

You'll be using HTML and CSS, but as you think about your layout,
you might want to start thinking about logical sections of the page
(header, footer, sidebarâ€”if you want any of these things),
and how you might structure those with HTML.

- head containing fonts and link to css page 
- header with title and background image 
- block posts proken into divs with h1 title, img, and p actual text of post
